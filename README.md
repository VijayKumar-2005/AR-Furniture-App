# AR Furniture App

Welcome to the **AR Furniture App**! This Flutter application allows users to browse a catalog of furniture items, view them in augmented reality (AR), and manage a shopping cart. The app integrates AR functionality using the `camera` package and provides a seamless shopping experience.

## Features

- **Furniture Catalog**: Browse a wide range of furniture items with details like name, description, price, and rating.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: View selected furniture items in AR to visualize how they would look in your space.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add items to your cart, view the total price, and clear the cart when needed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Cart data is saved locally using Hive, ensuring your selections are retained even after closing the app.
